# this file is mainly about tests --> best practice to store in respective folder of the models and using the used syntax
# these are generic tests (the built-in ones), they store the sql similarly as singular tests (e.g. unique is select from row count query)
# generic tests are set via yml (like this): models --> model name as one item (of n items) --> columns --> name as one item (of n items) --> data_test --> one/multiple of the tests as one item of 4
# type of generic tests:
  # unique = checks for uniqueness (good pro primary keys)
  # not_null = column doesnt contain any null (--//--)
  # accepted_values --> requires more config --> colon, new row, indent, arguments, colon, new row, indent, values, colon, list of accepted value
    # troubleshooting when failed: target dir --> compiled dir --> generic_test dir --> find the code that dbt ran --> preview it (in directory view DMs)
    # its case SENsitive
  # relationships = tests referential integrity; requires a bit more config too
    # in this case (PK is customer_id in customer, FK is customer_id in orders) testing this 1:N --> is there primary key for those foreign keys?
    # the more config: (belo the test name): identent, arguments, colon, new line, indent, to, colon, ref("table name"), new line, field, colon, name of the column
    # = checking that EACH foreign key (customer_id) in foreign table (orders) is represented as a primary key (customer_id) in the primary/paren table (customers)
    # its about subset --> not expecting 1:1

# X singular tests are sql, custom, written by dbt user
  # logics that is unique to a specific model --> run againts a model
  # in tests dir: name of the file = name of the test in the logs

# dbtf test to run all tests
# tests can be run on models, but here we are running on columns now
